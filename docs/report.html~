    <h1> An Inner perspective on Topological Data Analysis(TDA)</h1>
    <h2> Abstract </h2>
    <p> This manuscript investigates the influence of shape of the
    data on the persistent diagrams produced by TDA. This document
    also provides a brief outline on how TDA works in Mathematical
    sense. It also introduces the reader Mathematical concepts that
      are essential for understanding of TDA.</p>
    <h2> Mathematical Background </h2>
    <p> We here assume the reader is familiar with topological
    concepts such as Toplogical spaces, Topology,Homemorphisms,Open
    and Closed sets.</p>
    <h3> Fundamental Problem in Topology </h3>
    <! Bold the below line>
    <p> Are two topological space equivalent?</p>
    
    <p>The whole study of topology is to based on the above question.
    We need to find a homemorphisim between two given spaces to prove
    that there are equivalent, and this procedure is difficult.So, we
    try and show a relatively simpler problem that is to show that two
    spaces are not eqivalent we find topological invariants in both
    the spaces and if they are not equal then we conclude the space
    are not equivalent.One such topological invariant is called the
      Fundamental Group.</p>
    <h4>Homotopy of Paths </h4>
    <p> Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. If $f,f^{'}$ are
    continuous maps from the space $X$ into $Y$, we say $f$ is
      homotopic to $f^{'}$ if there exist a continuous map
      $F:X \times [0,1] \rightarrow Y$
      such that $F(x,0)=f(x)$ and $F(x,1)=f^{'}(x)$ for each $x$.</p>

    <h4>Homotopy</h4>
    <p> Homotopy is the collection of continuous 1-parameter family of
    maps from $X \rightarrow Y$. As the parameter continuously changes
    from o to 1, the functions continuously deform from $f$ to
      $f'$.</p>
    <! Add a image here for homotopy >

    <h4> Path Homotopic </h4>
    <p>Two paths $f$ and $f'$ mapping $[0,1]$ into $X$ are said to be
    path homotopic if they have same initial point $x_{0}$ and same
      final point $x$ and if there is a cont map
      $F:[0,1] \times [0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $F(s,0)=f(s)$,
      $F(s,1)=f'(s)$, $F(0,t)=x_{0}$ and $F(1,t)=X_{0}$ </p>

    <em> Homotopy and Path-Homotopy are equivalance relations. Hence
    they partition the space of paths into equivalance classes call it
    S. </em>

    <h4> Product of paths </h4>
    <p> $f$ is a path in $X$ from $x_{0} \rightarrow x_{1}$<br>
      $g$ is a path in $X$ from $x_{1} \rightarrow x_{2}$
      then the product $f*g$ is the path $h$ st
      <div lang="latex">
	h(s)=\begin{cases} 
      f(2s) & s \in [0,\frac{1}{2}] \\
      g(2s-1)& s\in [\frac{1}{2},1] \\
       \end{cases}
      </div> </p>

     <p>$h$ is continuous and well defined path from
       $x_{0} \rightarrow x_{2}$</p>

  <em> The equivalance classes S along with the product operation
    forms a Groupoid. </em>

   <p> It forms a groupoid instead of a group because, the product
   betwen two paths is always not defined. So to $S$ into a group we
   will set $x_{0} \in X$ as a base point and restrict all homotopic
   classes that start and end at the basepoint call it $G$. Now $G$ is
   group with the product operation. We call this group
   $G=\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ as the <strong>Fundamental group of
   $X$</strong> relative to the base point $x_{0}$</p>

   <h4> Properties of Fundamental group </h4>
   <! Fill in >
   <ul>
     <li> <p>If $X$ is path connected and $x_{0},x_{1}$ are two points
       of $X$ then $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is isomorphic to
	 $\pi_{1}(X,x_{1})$ </p></li>
     <li> Fundamental group is a topological invariant of the space
       X </li>
     <li> Fundamental group of two homeomorphic spaces are isomorphic
     but the converse does not hold </li>
     
     
   </ul>
<h3> Simplicial Complexes </h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p> Simplicial complexes are made of collection of
simplices(satisfying some properties), which are generalization of
triangles in k-dimensions. These simplices are basic building blocks
of topology which we will be constructing from the Data point in
higher dimension. Given any two spaces $X$ and $Y$ we can decompose
  them into simplices $\{X\}_{i},\{Y\}_{i}$ and any continuous map
  $f:X \rightarrow Y$ can be approximated by a linear map $f_{i}$ on each
simplex $i$. Moreover this approximating map $\sum_{i}f_{i} \equiv f$ ie, they belong to same homotopy class.</p>
<h4> Convex Independent </h4>
<p> A set $\{V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k} \}$ of vectors in a vector space
  $V$ is convex independent if the set $\{V_{1}-V_{0},V_{2}-V_{0},\dots,V_{k}-V_{0} \}$ is linearly independent.</p>
<h4> Closed k-Simplex-[] </h4>
<p> Let $\{V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k} \}$ be a convex independent set
then the smallest convex set containing $\{V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k} \}$
  is called a close k-simplex of dimension k.</p>

<h4> Barycentric coordinates </h4>
    <p>If $v \in [V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k}]$ a k-closed simplex then if
      $v=\sum_{i} a_{i} V_{i}$ then the coefficients $a_{i}$ with
      $a_{i} \geq 0,\sum_{i} a_{1} =1$ is called the barycentric
      coordinates.</p>

    <h4> Open simplex-() </h4>
    <p> Let $\{V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k} \}$ be a convex independent
      set, the set
      $\{v \in [V_{0},V_{1},\dots,V_{k}],a_{i} > 0,i=1,2,\dots,k\}$
      is called the open simplex.</p>
    <h4> Simplicial Complex </h4>
   <p> A simplicial complex (K) is a finite set of open simplicies in
     some ${\rm I\!{R}^{n}$ such that
     <ol>
       <li> <p>If $(s) \in (K)$ then all open faces of $[S] \in (K)$ </li></p>
       <li> <p>If $(s_{1}),(s_{2}) \in K$ and $(s_{1}) \cap (s_{2}) \neq \phi $ then
	 $(s_{1})=(s_{2})$</li></p>
       </ol>
